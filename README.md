# Game of Thrones-Text Mining
Here I have created a python project that reads an excel file containing information on the deaths on Game of Thrones. Within this file it contains the; order,	season, episode,	character_killed,	killer,	method,	method_cat,	reason,	location,	allegiance,	and importance. I have sorted the killers column from most to least and have created a word cloud illustrating the top killers in the show.
The image of the word cloud made can be shown here:
